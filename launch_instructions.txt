To build, use catkin build instead of catkin_make


roslaunch ouster_ros ouster.launch sensor_hostname:=os-122139000926.local metadata:=./data
roslaunch transforms transforms.launch
roslaunch linefit_ground_segmentation_ros segmentation.launch
roslaunch slam slam.launch (This also launches the LIDAR, you don't need to launch ouster_ros too)
